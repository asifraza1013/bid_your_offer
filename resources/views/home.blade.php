                    {{-- <p><b>Bid Your Offer</b> provides a brand-new approach to <b>real estate bidding</b>. It allows Sellers
                        and Buyers to enjoy full transparency when it comes to purchasing <b>real estate properties</b>.
                        Instead of blindly bidding on a property, Buyers/Buyer’s agents can easily see what others are
                        proposing. As a result, they can bid accordingly and can acquire their desired property.</p>
                    <p>Sellers/Seller’s agents will set up an auction according to their Terms and Conditions. Sellers can
                        define the terms for their listing and Buyers can bid on their property of choice by providing their
                        offering price and terms.</p>
                    <p>Both parties can include their terms on this platform before having to solidify a contract. This
                        process keeps everything simple and transparent for all parties. Once the Seller accepts the winning
                        bid, then the Seller/Seller’s agent will provide the Buyers/Buyer’s Agent agent with the contract
                        and necessary addendums.</p>
                    <p>By utilizing this transparent <b>real estate bidding platform</b>, we aim to create a solid
                        foundation for Trust and Honesty for all parties, as these traits are fundamentally the most
                        important aspects to all parties in a real estate transaction.

                        <b>Bid Your Agent</b> is a real estate platform that simplifies the process of hiring a real estate
                        agent for buyers, sellers, landlords, tenants, and agents. Our goal is to provide all the necessary
                        information to make an informed decision and hire the right agent for residential, income, and
                        commercial properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sellers and landlords provide specific property information, while buyers and tenants provide their
                        desired property criteria, commission or buyer's rebate requested, services requested from the
                        agent, whether they desire a free property value analysis from the agent, and other relevant
                        details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a seller, buyer, landlord, tenant, or real estate agent has a preferred agent or agents they want
                        to bid to be their agent, they can include the agent's contact information and have their known
                        local realtor or realtors compete for the job. Alternatively, they can share their listing link or
                        QR code of the listing for agents to bid to be their agent. The person creating the listing can also
                        choose between auction (timer) or traditional style (no timer) listing and include "Hire Now" terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Real estate agents will submit bids to become your agent and provide their contact information,
                        offered commission or buyer's rebate, marketing strategy, marketing materials, services offered,
                        virtual video presentations, and other relevant details to secure the job. Real estate agents can
                        hire another agent to assist them with specific flat fee services or showings. They can also serve
                        as referral agents or be hired as referral agents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, sellers and buyers have the option to request a rebate of up to 0.5% from their agent.
                        This rebate will be credited to the buyer at closing and can be used to cover their closing costs or
                        reduce their interest rates. For sellers, this rebate can help them better market their property to
                        buyers and differentiate it from other properties in the area that do not offer rebates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Agents who are hired on this platform can list properties for sellers and landlords, as well as
                        buying and leasing criteria for buyers and tenants, on our platform BidYourOffer.com. This enables
                        them to receive transparent bids from users that include not only the offered price, but also the
                        pertinent terms for the property listings or the buying and leasing criteria listings.
