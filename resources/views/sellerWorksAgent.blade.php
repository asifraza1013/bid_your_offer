          <h1>How It Works for Seller's Agents?</h1>
          <p>Bid Your Offer provides a transparent real estate bidding platform. Seller’s agents can post their property on this real estate platform for free to provide their Sellers, Buyers, and Buyer’s agents with a transparent bidding platform. Seller’s Agents will be able to list their property and include all their acceptable terms including purchase price, financing/cash terms, escrow amount, inspection period, closing date, and any contingencies they will accept. Buyers will have a fair opportunity to bid their highest and best on this platform by submitting their offering price, financing/cash terms, escrow deposit amount, days of inspection, closing date, and any contingencies. Before bidding on a property the Buyer/Buyer’s agents must send their Buyers proof of funds or pre approval letter and a valid ID to the Seller’s agent or their offer can be considered null and void.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">Why Use Bid Your Offer?</h2>
      <p>Bid Your Offer is a means for all parties to create transparency in every Real Estate transaction. The number one quality Sellers and Buyers look for in a Real Estate Transaction is Trust. Sellers and Buyers can rely on Bid Your Offer platform to provide all the important offering terms of a transaction by putting every party on the same playing field.</p>
      <p>Seller’s can have confidence by utilizing this platform it creates Trust and Transparency for all parties and ensures Seller’s will be presented with all offers fairly and timely. Buyers no longer have to be disappointed that their offer wasn’t selected because of the lack of transparency with the other competing offers. Sellers, Buyers, and Realtors can avoid going back and forth with negotiations of the contract terms and will only need to complete the contract once the Seller selects the winning bid.</p>
      <p>Typically, numerous Buyers propose similar price/terms without putting up their best offer because they are unaware of the other offering prices/terms. Bid Your Offer is a means for all parties to be more transparent because Buyers can now be aware of what other Buyers are offering instead of guessing. The results can be numerous bids competing and Buyers putting their best offer forward. In many cases had a buyer known they missed out on a property by only a few thousand dollars, they would have paid it.</p>
